# Directory Mapper

A simple tool to generate a text-based map of any directory‚Äôs structure, with an optional `.gitignore`-based exclusion feature.

---

## üöÄ Features

- **Directory Tree Mapping**: Recursively walks through a given folder and outputs a neat, indented tree view into `directory_map.txt`.
- **Optional `.gitignore` Exclusion**: Detects a `.gitignore` file in the target folder and prompts you whether to exclude matching files/folders (default: **Yes**).
- **Standalone Executable**: Pre-built `.exe` available‚Äîno Python install required.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage

### A. Running from Source

```bash
python dirmap.py
```

1. **Enter the target directory path**, e.g. `C:/Projects/MyRepo`.
2. If a `.gitignore` file is present, you‚Äôll be asked:

   > Exclude files and folders from the .gitignore file? [Y/n]

   - **Y** (default): Patterns from `.gitignore` will be honored.
   - **N**: All files/folders will be included.

3. After completion, check `directory_map.txt` in your current working directory for the tree output.

### B. Running the Standalone Executable

1. Download the latest `dirmap.exe` from the [Releases](https://github.com/anuradha2025/directory-mapper/releases) page.
2. Double-click or run in a console:
   ```bash
   ./dirmap.exe
   ```
3. Follow the same prompts as above.
